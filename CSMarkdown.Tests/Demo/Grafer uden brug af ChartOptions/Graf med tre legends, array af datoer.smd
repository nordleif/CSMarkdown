Getting data for P000_NIV, P000_M3, P000_AMP, using the readtags method, wich takes connection, interval, array of datetimes(instead of from and to), and 
lastly the array of tags.
Furthermore, this test also shows, that eventhoug fx the first DateTime item is 2016.05.29, it will only use year and month, since the interval was set to Month.
## CS Syntax
```{s echo=true}

var con = "data source=s2kapp1;initial catalog=sys2000;integrated security=false; user=sys2000; password=sys2000";

var data = ReadTags(con, Interval.Month, new[]{ new DateTime(2016, 05, 29), new DateTime(2016, 07, 02), new DateTime(2016, 08, 03)}, "P000_NIV", "P000_M3", "P000_AMP");
RenderChart(data);

```
